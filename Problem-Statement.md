# Real-Time Fraud Detection System Design

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a real-time fraud detection system for a large e-commerce platform. The system must be capable of identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions within milliseconds.

---

## Scenario

You are tasked with designing and implementing a **real-time fraud detection system** for a **large e-commerce platform**. The system must be able to identify and prevent **fraudulent transactions within milliseconds**.

---

## Constraints

- **High-volume data**: The platform processes millions of transactions per day.
- **Real-time performance**: Fraud detection must occur in real-time to minimize losses.
- **Scalability**: The system must handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising performance.
- **Accuracy**: The system must have a high accuracy rate to minimize false positives and negatives.
- **Data privacy**: Sensitive customer data must be protected in accordance with relevant regulations.

## Requirements

### 1. Architecture Design and Approach
- Develop a high-level architecture proposal.
- Ensure modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant design.

### 2. Technology Selection
- Choose appropriate tools for:
    - **Data ingestion**
    - **Stream processing**
    - **Modeling & Detection**

### 3. Algorithm Development
- Design machine learning or statistical models to identify fraudulent patterns.
- Consider supervised, unsupervised, or hybrid approaches.

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Optimize for latency and throughput.
- Use techniques like model quantization, distributed processing, and in-memory computation.

### 5. Security Measures
- Ensure robust security protocols.
- Implement access control, encryption, and regular audits to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.
